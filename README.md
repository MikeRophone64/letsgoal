# Let's Goal!
## Description
Let's Goal is an app that allows you to set goals, add steps to them to track your progress until you've accomplished them. Users can like Goals posted by other users to get some inspiration.
Their User Profile gives them a quick overview of all the Goals they have created, the ones that are _not started_, _in progress_ and _accomplished_.

## What I have learned with this project
With this final project I have attempted to user more in depth Django features, as well as other practices such as:
- Creating and using a virtual environment 
- Learning to use Git, adding, committing, pushing and pulling
- Creating a Django REST API using the Django REST Framework
- Creating Serializers in a seperate file
- Uploading files (mostly images) to the Database
- Using SVG for items such as Like buttons and manipulate their style
- Making use of jQuery to manipulate the DOM
- Learing and using Sass
