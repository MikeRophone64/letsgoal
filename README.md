# Let's Goal!
## Description
Let's Goal is an app that allows you to set goals, add steps to them to track your progress until you've accomplished them. Users can like Goals posted by other users and even copy them if they like to!

## Specifications
With this final project I have attempted to user more in depth Django features, as well as other practives such as:
- learning to use Git, adding, committing, and pushing to branches
- Creating a Django REST API using the Django REST Framework
- Uploading files to the Database
- Using svg for items such as Like buttons, fill them 
- Making use of jQuery to manipulate the DOM
